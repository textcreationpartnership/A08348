            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Q. 3. <hi>What are the names, and vſes of our vſuall</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Ordnance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, the double <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Cannon</hi> of eight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches high, and the whole <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Cannon</hi> of ſeuen inches high in bore, and the Di. <hi>Canons,</hi> and ſecondly the whole and Demy Culuerings, all which are vſed in Batteries, eſpecially the <hi>Canons,</hi> by reaſon the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight of their ſhots doe batter and ſhake a wall or defence, more than lighter ſhot could doe; the <hi>Culuerings</hi> are moſt commonly to reach ſarre off, and yet to beat into a ſtrong oppoſing marke or obiect, with a large Orafice.

Or elſe they are chambred, and hauing Chambers to put in behind their chaſes to load them with, as the <hi>Fowler</hi> Port-peece, <hi>Slings, Portingale Baſes</hi> haue.</p>
            <p>Q. 4. <hi>What and how many are the Simples or Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls of Gun-powder, and their qualities, and how are they to be Refined and proportionally Mixed or Compounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Simples whereof Powder is made and compounded, are only three, namely, <hi>Salpeter,</hi> which is the <hi>ſoule,</hi> and <hi>Sulpher,</hi> which is the <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Cole,</hi> which is the <hi>Body</hi> thereof. For the qualities, <hi>Salpeeter</hi> will rarifie, being fired, and turne into wind, which cauſeth the force. The <hi>Sulpher</hi> will kindle, and take fire quickly; and the Coale will maintaine the fire and carry them vp together. <hi>Salpeter</hi> is beſt refined, being diſſolued in a little water, and boiled &amp; ſcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, being ſet to congeale, it will in part ſhoot like Iſicles into roch, which is the beſt; the reſt may be either ſo refined again, or cleanſed from the Feces of greaſe, Alum and ſalt which accompany it. <hi>Sulpher</hi> is cleanſed by melting it often, and ſtraining it tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a ſtrong canuas cloth. The Coale if it be well burned of Alder, Hazle, birch and young wood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out barke or knot, will alſo be rectified for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. When a quantity of Powder is to be made, firſt reſolue of the vſe, whether it be for <hi>Ordnance, Musket,</hi> or <hi>Piſtoll,</hi> for <hi>Ordnance,</hi> called <hi>Canon</hi> Powder greaſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20146:5"/>or the Receit called foure, one and one. And for the <hi>Musket,</hi> called <hi>Hargubuſſe</hi> Powder, and for <hi>Piſtoll</hi> fine Powder, the firſt is of fiue, one and one, the latter of ſix, one and one, by which is meant foure, ſiue, or ſix parts of <hi>Peeter,</hi> to one part of <hi>Sulpher,</hi> and one part of <hi>Coale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 5. <hi>How much Powder is it fit to allow each Peece for proofe, and for Action?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> For the <hi>Cannons</hi> proofe ⅘ and for ſeruice ½ of the weight of her iron ſhot, for the <hi>Culuering</hi> and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <hi>Ordnance,</hi> the whole weight of their proper ſhots for proofe, and for Action for the <hi>Culuering</hi> ⅔, and for the <hi>Saker</hi> and <hi>Falcon</hi> ⅘, and for leſſer Peeces the whole weight in Action vntill they grow hot, for then muſt abatement be made with diſcretion. But in proofe the ſmall Peeces ſhould haue once and ⅓ of Powder that the ſhots weigheth.</p>
            <p>Q. 6. <hi>What if Ordnance Powder of</hi> 4.1.1. <hi>be wanting, and yet Hargubuſſe or fine Powder be in ſtore, how will you then proportion your Charge?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There are three differences in Fortification of each ſort of Ordnance, be they of the kindes of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> or of <hi>Culuerings;</hi> For they are either ordinarily Fortified, or leſſened, or double fortified, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or <hi>Legitimate</hi> Peeces, <hi>Baſtard</hi> Peeces, or <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Peeces. For the <hi>Cannon</hi> double Fortified, hath fully one Diametre in thickneſſe of Metall at her <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and 11/16 at her <hi>Trunions,</hi> and 7/16 at her <hi>Necke,</hi> whereas the ordinary fortified <hi>Cannons</hi> haue but ⅞ at at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and ⅝ at the <hi>Trunions,</hi> and but ⅜ at the <hi>Necke.</hi> And the leſſened <hi>Cannons</hi> haue at the <hi>Touch-hole</hi> but ¾, and at the <hi>Trunions</hi> 9/16, and at the <hi>Necke</hi> 5/16. Now all the double fortified <hi>Culuerings,</hi> and all leſſer Peeces of that kind, haue one diametre and ⅛ in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Metall at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and 15/16 at the <hi>Truni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and 9/16 at the <hi>Necke.</hi> And the ordinary fortified <hi>Culuerings</hi> haue like to the double fortified <hi>Cannons,</hi> but one diametre of Metal in thickneſſe at the <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole,</hi> 11/16 at the <hi>Trunions,</hi> and 7/16 at the <hi>Necke.</hi> And the leſſened <hi>Culuerings</hi> haue ⅞ at the <hi>Touch-hole,</hi> and at the <hi>Trunions</hi> ⅝, and at the <hi>Necke</hi> but ⅜, as the ordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified <hi>Cannons</hi> haue.</p>
            <p>Q. 12. <hi>What are the difference betweene the</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>or</hi> Legitimate <hi>Peeces, and the</hi> Baſtard <hi>Peeces, and the</hi> Extraordinary <hi>Peeces?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A. Common</hi> or <hi>Legitimate</hi> Peeces are ſuch Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as haue a due length of their Chaſes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned according to the height of their proper Bores, euen as they are expreſſed in the laſt prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20146:7"/>Table, <hi>Baſtard</hi> Peeces are ſuch as haue ſhorter Chaſes than the proportion of their Bore doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire: and <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Peeces, are ſuch Ordnance as haue longer Chaſes than the proportion of the Bore alloweth. And they are called <hi>Baſtard Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary Culuerings,</hi> and ſo <hi>Baſtard Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Faulcons,</hi> or <hi>Extraordinary Sakers</hi> or <hi>Faulcons,</hi> &amp;c. accordingly as their Bores come neareſt to the <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, Saker,</hi> or <hi>Falcon</hi> Bores, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Q. 13. <hi>How will you finde whether a Peece of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance be cleare from Flawes, Crackes, and Hony combe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Hauing firſt clenſed and cleared the Peece with a Wad-hook and Ladle, from all loading, foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, duſt and ſtones, which you may know by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Rammer head vp to the Breech, and with a priming iron put downe into the Touch-hole, if it take hold of the Rammer head, it is cleare of loading and ſtones, then the Ladle and ſpung will get out the duſt. But to know whether any Crackes, Flawes, or Hony-combes be within her Chaſe or Chamber, put in an vſuall <hi>Searcher,</hi> made with two or three ſprings with points like great pinnes heads, bending out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which being bended together with your hand, vntill it will enter into the mouth of the Peece, and that put vp to the bottome of the Bore, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned round in the motion of pulling it in and out of the Chaſe; ſo if any Hony-combes be therein, it will ſticke with the points in the ſaid Flaw, Crack or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny-combe. Alſo in a ſun-ſhine day, with a looking-glaſſe, the Sunne beams may ſo be reflected into the Chaſe, as that all flawes, crackes and ſpungie Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combes may be diſcerned. Or if the Sun ſhine not, a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20146:8"/>Wax candle lighted and put vpon the end of a halfe Pike, or a bright Sword, will alſo reflect the Sunne-beames, as afore-ſaid. Now if no flaw be found, you may proceed to her proofe, but if any be therein, that Peece is dangerous for breaking, and ſecond lading, and had need to be carefully proued, and reſpectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, leſt in Lading the ſecond time, any fire remaine therein to enflame the ſecond Charge. Therefore, if any ſuch Peece muſt needs be vſed, you muſt notneglect to ſpunge her well firſt, with a wet ſpunge. And alſo after ſpunging, aduiſement taken, not to allow ſuch Peeces the ordinary lading of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but with diſcretion an abatement muſt be made, more or leſſe, according as the fault or defect is found to be more or leſſe.</p>
            <p>Q. 14. <hi>What if the mouth of a Peece be growne wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then the reſt of her Chaſe within, by meanes of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, how will you chooſe ſhot ſit for her?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I will trie with ſeuerall Rammers heads, or if need be, Face them by little and little, vntill I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by finde the loweſt bore within the Chaſe (except the <hi>Camber</hi> be Taper-bored, as the <hi>Drakes</hi> and ſome <hi>Periors</hi> are) and then fit my ſhot to that loweſt bore, alwayes allowing 1/20 of that height for vent.</p>
            <p>Q. 15. <hi>What if you be commanded to ſerue with a Peece that hath lyen long charged, that either the ſhot is growne faſt to the inſide of the Peece with ruſt, or the ſhot being torted too high, or ouall doth ſticke by the way, and ſo may be dangerous for Peece, and Gunner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> I wil not aduenture to diſcharge a Peece ſo long loaded, as I may not know what accidents ſince haue
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20146:8"/>hapned, but with a Wad-hooke will draw the Wad, and try with the Ladle to draw or moue the ſhot; which if I cannot doe, I will firſt eleuate her, and powre warme water in at her mouth (and ſtop the Touch-hole) to diſſolue the Petre, and eight or ten houres after, I will vnbaſe her, (ſetting a veſſell vnder her mouth) to receiue the liquor that ſhal drain out; then a day or two after I will put in a ſmall quantitie of drie powder at the Touch-hole, and try if I can blow out the ſhot therewith, if not, I will then powre in warme oyle and vineger, and turne her round, ſo that the vpper ſide may be ſide-wiſe and downwards in that motion; then with her Ladle or Rammer, or both, I ſhall doubtleſſe looſen the ſhot, and ſo draw it, or blow it out, otherwiſe the Peece will be euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnſeruiceable without new founding.</p>
            <p>Q. 16. <hi>What Inſtruments are moſt fit for a Gunners vſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The Callibre Compaſſes, Height-boord, Inch ſight-rule, Gunners Scale, Gunners Quadrant diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ninetie degrees, and into twelue points and their minutes, with a Geometricall ſquare to take mountures, leuels, heights, breadths, and diſtances, and a paire of ſtraight pointed Compaſſes.</p>
            <p>Q. 17. <hi>How doe you diſpart a Peece or Ordnance, what is it, and to what end vſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> To diſpart a Peece, is to finde the difference betweene the Diametres or thickneſſe in metall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the Muzle-ring, and abaft at the Baſe-ring, for in true bored Peeces the halfe of the difference of their Diametres is the due diſpart. Thoſe Diametres are readily found by the Callibre Compaſſes opened
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20146:9"/>and applied to the oppoſite ſides of thoſe Rings, and to a Scale or Inch-rule of ſmall equall parts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the difference will ſoone appeare, which halfed is the diſpart found. Their Diametres differences alſo may bee found by guirting them with a labell of parchment or cord, that will not ſhrinke nor ſtretch, diuiding the guirt in three equall parts at each time, ⅓ may be tollerably accepted for the Diametre. Alſo in true equall bored Peeces, putting in a Priming iron at the Touch-hole, to the bottome of the bore, and marking a place vpon it equall in height to the Baſe-rings higheſt part, which applied vpon the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the bore at the mouth, perpendicularly, will ſhew the length of the diſpart aboue the higheſt of the Muzle-ring. Likewiſe you may finde both thoſe Diametres by laying a rule or ſtraight ſtaffe leuelly, making a Tangent on each of thoſe Rings ſeuerally, and on each ſide of the Peece holding a plummet line, ſo that it onely touch the ſides of the metall of each Ring, the differences betweene thoſe Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres ſo found halfed, is the diſpart ſought. It may be found many other wayes, but theſe being ſufficient, I will only anſwer concerning the end and vſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. It ſerueth to direct the ſhot to the marke, or ſo neere as is the diſtance betweene the two parallels that are made by the two continued lines, the one the Axis of the bore, the other the viſuall line that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from the Gunners eye by the higheſt part of the Baſe-ring and top of the Diſpart vnto the marke. For ſeeing the Breech of the Peece is of ſolid metall, not ſo tranſparant that the Gunner can viſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Axis of the bore preciſely to the marke, it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20146:9"/>muſt ſuffice to finde the other viſuall line, being the neereſt that can parallelly betaken thereunto, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it, for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Q. 18. <hi>How much will you allow for vent, comparing the height of the ſhot with the height of the bore of the Peece aſsigned?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> One twentieth part will be ſufficient, approued ſo to be by the beſt Gunners of late times, although many Gunners of <hi>England</hi> generally allow a quarter of an inch for each ſhot to be lower then the bore of of euery Peece, which is too little for a <hi>Cannon,</hi> but too much for a <hi>Falcon,</hi> and for leſſer Peeces.</p>
            <p>Q. 19. <hi>What difference is there betweene ſhooting by the metall of the Peece, and by the Diſpart, to direct a Peece to a marke leuell or eleuated?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Their differences are ſomewhat vncertaine, becauſe there are ſeldome any conſtant proportions held in founding Ordnance, concerning the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their Baſe and Muzle-rings; but in moſt Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are ſo, that firſt laying the Peece to the mark with a due Diſpart, and then by the metall, obſeruing with a Quadrant, you ſhall ſometimes finde that the Peece will be eleuated more by the metall, then by the Diſpart, foure degrees, fiue degrees, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſix or ſeuen degrees. And ſo accordingly will the Randons of the metall bee more then the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of the Diſpart, which (by the Table of dead Ranges for each degree here annexed, or by the Gunners Scale) may for euery eleuation be made cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knowne. But on the leuell the metall rangeth neare double the diſtance of the Diſpart, in moſt Peeces.</p>

            <p>Q. 20. <hi>How ſhall a Gunner know how the Range of his Peece encreaſeth, or decreaſeth, from degree to degree?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, hee muſt finde by the Table or Right ranges, expreſt in the Art of <hi>Great Artillery,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; how much the leuell right range of your Peece is, which number of paces diuide by 25, and multiply the Quotient by 11, and the product will be the firſt and greateſt digreſſion, which is betweene the firſt and ſecond degrees, which diuide by fortie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees contained betweene the firſt degree and 42 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, the beſt or vtmoſt Randon, and the Quotient ſhall be the number of paces that the ſhot ſhal loſe at euery digreſſion from degree to degree to the beſt Randon, and contrariwiſe for their increaſing digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from 42 degrees, the vtmoſt Randon downe to the firſt degree.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:20146:10"/>Q. 21. <hi>At how many degrees of Mounture, will any Peece conuay her ſhot fartheſt, called her vtmoſt Randon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> At about 42 degrees, neuertheleſſe, that 45 hath formerly beene generally taken for the beſt or vtmoſt Randon, being the middle or meane degree betweene the leuell and the perpendicular, namely, the halſe of ninety degrees: But becauſe the Peece on the leuell Rangeth a ſhot about one tenth part of the vtmoſt Randon, as it doth alſo at 84 degrees of Mounture; therefore it ſtands with more reaſon, and experience alſo hath found, that the vtmoſt Randon of any Peece ſhould be (being duly charged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged) at 42 degrees, the halfe of 84 degrees of eleuation.</p>
            <p>Q. 22. <hi>How doe you direct your Peece to ſhoot at a warke, being for diſtance, within the Straight line, or Right range of the Peece, and lying leuell with the Horizon?</hi>

            <p>Q. 23. <hi>But how will you direct a Peece of Ordnance to ſhoot at a marke that lieth leuell, but is further diſtant then the Peece can reach vpon her leuell Range, you hauing only ſome certaine dead range, and the diſtance from that Peece to the marke giuen; what aduantage will you take to reach the marke, to make a faire ſhot at the firſt time?</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Hauing a certain Dead range for any eleuation

            <p>Q. 24. <hi>What if the marke be eleuated aboue the leuell, and be farther diſtant then the Peece vpon that mounture can reach in a Right range: How will you direct your Peece for aduantage, hauing the Diſtance and ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Dead range of that Peece giuen?</hi>

            <p>Q. 30. <hi>How would you chooſe and order a Peece, to make a good ſhot at a moueable marke; as at an enemies Ship vnder ſaile, Boat rowing, or Horſe-man riding?</hi>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hauing loaded the Peece, I obſerue how the Marke moueth. Thirdly, I will obſerue the wind (if it blow much) whether it be againſt, or with, me, or ſide-wayes, and accordingly take aduantage, for the impediment it may produce otherwiſe. Then will I, with the Diſpart conſidered, duely obſerue ſome cloud, or marke ſome point of Landskip that lieth in the courſe of his motion; and when according to the ſwiftneſſe thereof, he is come ſo neere it, as I gueſſe the ſhot and hee may meet at the marke, I ſo giue fire, wherein I may remember this ſecret of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that any Peece will ſhoot further from Sea

               <hi>A.</hi> That kinde of ſhooting is farre more vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and difficile then any other, by reaſon of the ſmaller reſiſtance the ſhot makes againſt the force of the powder, naturally working vpwards, which is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Breech, if it were not there reſtrained, it therefore of all other wayes ſhooteth leaſt diſtance in a ſtraight line, vnleſſe it be perpendicularly down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, or neerely ſo; beſides, no Author or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner elſe, to my knowledge, hath diuulged any good vſe or order for the ſame. But I haue obſerued that the Randons for Imbaſures do ſomewhat neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decreaſe from degree to degree vnder the leuell, with a double proportion to the decreaſe of the Morter Peeces mounture, aboue from the beſt Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don vnto ninetie degrees.

               <hi>The vſe illuſtrated by example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At eight degrees Imbaſement a ſhot at a marke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be made with a <hi>Saker</hi> (for which Peece the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was made) if the diſtance were leſſe then 129 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then the Peece being able to reach the marke needs no aduantage: but ſuppoſing it to be 140 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a leſſe Imbaſement muſt be then giuen, namely, at about ſeuen degrees, to reach the marke, as reaſon will conduce.</p>
            <p>Q. 32. <hi>Can you make a reaſonable ſhot at a marke, which by reaſon of interpoſition of ſome hill, houſe, wall, Rampart, or other impediment, you cannot ſee it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, with a Morter Peece it is vſuall, if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her reach. And although the catriages of other Peeces, will few, admit to mount them ſo high as 20 degrees, yet by ſapping the Breech of the Peece, that is, by making a trench for the taile of the carriage to reuerſe in, being deſcended thereinto the wheeles ſtanding aloſt: or by preparing a Timber-frame, ſo that the taile may be ſuncke, as betweene two Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-logs ſquared, the wheeles reuerſing vpon them, any Peece may be ſo mounted to ſhoot at a mark out of ſight, further then any Morter Peece can reach, or by taking a Peece out of her carriage, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her accordingly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> skids at pleaſure to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation deſired; theſe may ſhoot <hi>Granadoes, Flaming</hi> or <hi>Venomous bals,</hi> and <hi>Hedge hegs</hi> or ſuch like moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily. But amongſt them the <hi>Canon Periors, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieraes</hi> and <hi>Bombards,</hi> are chiefly to be therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. Hauing then the diſtance giuen, Stales and Signals are to be placed, to ſhew where the marke is,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20146:14"/>which way, and how the ſhot lighteth ſhort, ouer, or wide, that ſuch errour may at the next time be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Q. 33. <hi>How would you order things, to ſhoot at a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of the Enemies Souldiers, and what Peeces would you chooſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> According to the diſtance I would chooſe a Peece that in a ſtraight line can ſhoot home, if I may, be it with <hi>Demy Culuering, Saker</hi> or <hi>Falcon,</hi> and plant my Peece as neere parallel to the champion Plaine as I can, that the ſhot may range, and ſhoot at girdle height, vnleſſe the ground be ſtony, for then would I place my ſhot ſhort of them, that grazing amongſt the ſtones, that ſtones may doe them more ſpoile then the ſhot of it ſelfe can doe, by farre; but in no caſe would I ſhoot wide, or ouer them, for that were both loſſe and ſhame alſo.</p>
            <p>Q. 34. <hi>At the time of ioyning of two Armies in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, how would you plant and mount your Ordnance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> There are diuers opinions therein; ſome ſay it is beſt to plant them in the Front, to diſorder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and cauſe them to breake their Ranks at firſt; which others diſliking, ſay, that will hinder their own party from many aduantages, and difficult to retire them: ſome would plant them in the Flanckes: And ſome would haue ſome of them in the Front, &amp; ſome in the Flanke: And laſtly, ſome would haue them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Armie, that vpon a ſigne giuen, their owne Squadrons may open a way for the <hi>Gunner</hi> to play vpon the Enemies Troops or Squadrons. But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are planted, care muſt be had, that the Musketiers, appointed for guards, nor any other fire
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20146:14"/>armes, approach within 100 Paces of the Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, leſt vntimely firing them worke miſchiefe to the party. But hauing viewed before-hand the place appointed for the Battell, if any eminent riſing-place be there neere, to lodge the Ordnance thereon, they may thence moſt ſafely play vpon the Enemie in Front, Flanke and Trauers, with wonderfull aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and hope of victory.</p>
            <p>Q. 35. <hi>Hauing found the firſt ſhot faulty, to the right or left hand, ouer or ſhort, how will you at the next amend it, to make an effectuall ſhot?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If it were wide, towards the right or left hand, I would place my eye on the Baſe-ring, at the next time, a little more to the ſame ſide, accordingly more or leſſe: if it were too high, direct the top of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnder the marke as much: if too low, lay ſome ſmall ſtone or ſtraw on the higheſt of the Baſe-ring, and by that, bring the diſpart and the Mark into one with diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Q. 36. <hi>What if the Peece by often ſhooting be growne ſo hot that it is dangerous, vnleſſe it be reſted or refreſhed; how will you coole her?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If the ſeruice be ſuch, as ſhe may not haue time to reſt, in that caſe, ſhe muſt be cooled with Spunges wet in Lee, which is beſt, or in vrin and water, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and vineger, or with the cooleſt freſh or ſalt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; bathing and waſhing her within and without, vntill ſhe be come to her due temper againe; but if I may, I will reſt her one or two houres in twelue, and between whiles coole her euery tenth or twelfth ſhot.</p>
            <p>Q. 37. <hi>If the Touch-hole be cloyed with ſpikes, ſtones or ſuch like, and neceſsitie requireth the vſe of the Peece, what would you doe therein?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:20146:15"/>
               <hi>A.</hi> Not truſt to that which ſome appoint, by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her on the Muzle with a woodden mallet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing powred warme oile in at her Touch-hole, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect her doying to fly out; nor to the ſetting of her Breech vpright, with her mouth ouer a fire, vntill ſhe be red-hot, and then (her metall being ſoft) to get out her cloying; but if I cannot blow it out, nor haue time to drill another new touch-hole more forwards, I muſt load her with powder and ſhot without wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and by a fuſee, wet vent, or powder moiſtned into paſte, placed at the mouth, ſo as it may fire a traine within the Chaſe that I will there make to fire the charge, to auoid danger as much as I can, ſo I will giue fire to the vent, hauing formerly laid my Peece to the marke, as I haue already ſaid.</p>
            <p>Q. 38. <hi>If you be ſo driuen, that of neceſsitie you muſt leaue your Ordnance to the Enemie, what would you doe either with hope to recouer them, or elſe to make them. vnſeruiceable, or breake the next time they ſhall bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If I haue no conueniencie to hide them ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, by burying them vnder ground, as that the Enemie ſhall not finde them, or be paſt hope that we may neuer come to the place to recouer them: Then would I lay all the Peeces croſſe a narrow ditch or trench, filled ſo with char-coales, or other dry fewell, to kindle, and heat them thorowly red-hot a good ſpace, which will cauſe the metall to become ſo bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle afterwards, being cold, that they will not be able to endure the due charge of powder to be fired in them, but will break in peeces at their next diſcharge; or I can break them either in that britle place, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20146:15"/>them with hard ſtrokes of a heauie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or by loading each Peece with more than a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble charge, and vnder and about the ſhot driuing ſteele wedges with rammers of hard wood, ſo that hauing fired the Peece with a fuſee or ſlow pyramid of powder moiſtned like paſte; the ſhot in diſcharge running vpon the thicker parts of the wedges will conſtraine the Peece to breake: I know diuers other wayes with a touch to breake or ſpoile the Enemies Ordnance, but I thinke it not fit to ſpeake of it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</p>
            <p>Q. 39. <hi>Being beſieged, to reſiſt aſſaults and defend the place, what Ordnance are beſt, and where placed, and how vſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> All Ordnance are vſefull, but for defence at a breach or narrow paſſage, <hi>Canon Periors,</hi> loaded with Lanthornes, filled with pible ſtones, Caſes of Baſe and Burre, old iron traſh chaind, langrell, croſſe bar, plugs, or any other tearing or murdring ſhot, or with a mine in their way to blow vp &amp; the like; &amp; planting the Ordnance couert ſo, as to ſcower the paſſage from a Flanker Caſſamat or other defence, or before the Breach. Alſo my new inuented Murtherers, that haue long ſquare tapering concaues, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are double or treble in breadth to their heights, and will ſpread their murthering ſhot, Musket or Piſtol bullets, ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe far, but little vp and downwards (without feare of ſtop or cloying the Chaſe, as in equal round Peeces oft hapneth, when they are charged with ſmall looſe ſhot or traſh.) Alſo I will carefully prouide to haue in ſtore, ſpare Carriages, Axtrees, Wheeles, Cordage, Match, Powder, and Shot ſufficient; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20146:16"/>alwayes the Enemie will chiefly endeuour to ruine our Defences, embouch our Loops, beat downe our Parapets and Defences, cloy our Plat-formes, diſmount our Ordnance, teare our Carriages, Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees and wheeles with their Peeces, by all the means they can poſſible.</p>
            <p>Q. 40. <hi>You hauing beleagerd or beſieged a Fort or Towne, how would you ſhoot to ruine, anney, or take away the enemies Defences; and what would you chiefly ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to doe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, I would make choice of places to plant my Ordnance, or make my Batteries ſo againſt the weakeſt parts, to make a Breach in the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place, bringing them by Trenches, as neere as I can, within leſſe then two hundred Paces; and then hauing raiſed and plained the Terraplenes and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, made the Plat-formes, cut and ſet out Loopes, or placed the Gabbions the whilſt, and planted Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they may moſt offend the Enemie, endc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring to ruine and embouch their Defences, ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſo hard, that they may not haue time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire the old, nor build new, nor retrench, as they elſe would doe. And alſo make what ſlaughter I can, to weaken the Aduerſary: and from each Battery fit, to ſhoot at the place for Breach, as many Peeces at once as can be brought to beare thereon: and I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue what Peeces of theirs, moſt endammage vs &amp; ours, and endeuour to diſmount them, and amaze and hinder their workes all I may. The diſtances of the Batteries muſt be according as the ſituation of the place will permit, but if poſſible, at eighty, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or an hundred and fifty Paces at moſt, auoiding
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20146:16"/>the danger of the Enemies Musketiers with conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Defences: the number of Peeces and the ſorts of them, are to be according to the place and the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to vſe them; <hi>Cannon, Demy Cannon</hi> and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering</hi> for Breach, and a <hi>Demy Culuering</hi> or two, to play vpon the Enemies Defences, with a Field-peece or two for ſingle markes. The Breadth of a Battery muſt be according to the length of the Curtin, and the number of Souldiers that muſt giue the aſſault, that nine in a ranke may at leaſt enter together.</p>
            <p>Q. 41. <hi>What Fire-workes are moſt ordinary and fit for warlike ſeruice, to ſpoile or annoy the Enemy most?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. Granadoes</hi> or hollow breaking balls of ſeuerall ſorts, Fire-balles for diuers vſes, as to enlighten the champion, ſticke and burne combuſtible obiects, burne and breake poiſon, or blinde the Enemy, burne in the water, or pierce the fleſh to the bone, where it fired, toucheth, Powder-pots ſimple and compound, Armed Trunkes, with Piſtols, Fire arrowes, barbed Garlands, Rowlers, Fire-pikes, and ſuch likeinuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Q. 42. <hi>Of what materialls are the Granado bals made, and what receits are they loaded with, and how armed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> As they are for diuers ends (though all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Enemie) ſo they are made of ſeuerall mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, as of Bell-metall, ſpelter, Iron, or any hard and britle metal. To be ſhot alſo out of a Mortar Peece or <hi>Perior,</hi> &amp; may alſo be thrown with the hand amongſt the Enemies: ſome are made of baked Potters clay, or of Glaſſe, and ſome of Canuas coated and armed: The receits are alſo diuers, as Powder foure ounces, Sulpher two ounces, Salpetre twelue ounces, finely
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20146:17"/>beaten and well mixed; ſometimes Antimoney and glaſſe, and Scales or Iron: but let a britle ball be filled with powder, one pound, within two fingers height, and the reſt with Cannon powder foure ounces, and Salpetre twelue ounces, mixt and driuen cloſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, incloſe this in Canuas, with the mouth or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-hole downwards, and fill it, as a ball, with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two parts, Sulpher one part, and Salpetre three parts; pierce a hole to fire at, and put into it a pinne of wood, and coat it with Roch-fire, or Roch ſulpher: alſo Powder ½ li, Peetre 1 li &amp; ½, Sulpher foure ounces, is an vſuall receipt: they may be made of two hollow Demy Globes of wood, bored full of holes almoſt thorow, hauing thence a touch-hole, each hole loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Piſtoll bullet, the concaue filled with fine powder, and a pipe of wood coated to reach to the bottome, filled with ſlower receipt, they may be loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Piſtoll-pipes of iron, and powder, and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets at each end, and a touch-hole in the midſt, their coatings may be ſtucke full of ſtones, nailes, ſhot, or ſuch like: Theſe are of great execution, but muſt euer be ſo prouided, that the ſlow fire muſt be ſure to burn vntill the ball fired be arriued at the place where it is to doe its execution; of this kinde there are infinite diuerſities and inuentions.</p>
            <p>Q. 43. <hi>What is that Roch-ſulpher, and Reeh fire?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Receipts of much vſe; Roch-ſulpher is made with one pound of Sulpher molten on a ſlow fire, and ¼ li of mealed powder, put thereto by little and little, and ſtirred wel together, and in the cooling put three ounces more of corne powder, mixing them well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Roch-fire is made of three pound of Sulpher
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20146:17"/>groſſe beaten, and ſlowly molten, to which put one pound of mutton ſewet, and therto Powder &amp; Salpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre equally mixed, with theſe you may couer or coat <hi>Granadoes, Pikes, Circles, Balls, Trunkes,</hi> and <hi>Arrowes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 44. <hi>What receipts for Lances, Trunkes and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pikes vſe you, and how make you them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The formes and receipts alſo are diuers; for one may bee of Powder and Sulpher, of each one pound, Salpetre three pound, Quick-ſiluer molten with Sulpher foure ounces, Glaſſe three ounces, each beaten to powder, and tempered with Linſeed oile, boiled vntil it wil ſcald a feather, put therin; theſe put in Canuas, narrow at both ends, fitting for Pikes or Arrowes, muſt after be put on, and armed either with Wire or Marline, and coated with Roch-fire, or other coatings, or Canuas dipped in Pitch and Tallow molten, Sulpher, Rozen, and Turpentine. Lances are little different, only leſſe; Trunkes are alſo of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts, moſt commonly made of wood, armed with iron hoopes, they may be eighteene inches long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſix inches bored in for the ſtaffe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is to be ten or twelue loot long, the eitghteene inches bored, two inches and ½ may be filled with Sulpher and Powder, of each one pound, Quick-ſiluer two ounces, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere one ounce, which beat with the Sulphere will become powder, mix theſe with Linſeed oyle, boiled as afore-ſaid, wowld it with Marlin, coat it and fill it with a handfull of this receipt, then with a handfull of powder, then with a button or with ſmall ſhot; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the end with a waxed or pitched Canuas, hauing a Match or Sulpher threed goe through all. Another receipt is Cannon powder fiue parts refined, Petre
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20146:18"/>three parts, Sulpher two parts, Rozen one part, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheer, Glaſſe, Amber, and Maſticke mealed and ſearced, of each ½ part, well mixed with oiles of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Petre, Linſeed, and liquid varniſh, of each ½ part. Another, take Powder three parts, Sulpher one part, Salpetre three parts, Maſticke one part, Vitrioll, white Wax, of each ſix parts, Amber, Orpiment, Arſenick, 4 parts, Verdegreaſe, Salarmoniak, each 2 parts, mixt with oiles of Linſeed, Petre, Varniſh, and Aquauitae, of each ſix parts, and well wrought, will be a receipt of great vehemencie in burning.</p>
            <p>Q. 45. <hi>What are your Fire-balls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> They are alſo of ſundry ſorts and vſes, ſome to light ſo, in the night, as to ſee what the Enemie wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth abroad; make a round ball of Canuas, and fill it either with Powder mealed, Sulpher, Salpetre, and Roch-ſulpher, of each one pound, mixed and preſſed hard &amp; cloſe, and made round, it being ſewed, armed, pierced, primed, &amp; coated with Roch-fire, rowled in corne powder, or with Roch-ſulpher molten, 1 li, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre 2 li, Powder 1 li, and ½, Rozen and Turpentine each ½ li; theſe primed through in foure places, and ſhot out of a Morter or Perior without wad, will take fire and burne very light. Some balls are to burne in the water, for which take of Powder 12 oz, Sulpher 6 oz, mixt, Campheere 1 oz, paſted with boiled Linſeed oile, and oile of Turpentine and new Wax, of each 4 oz mixt with coale 4 oz, Salpetre and Roch-fire, of each 1 oz, and ½; this made in a ball, armed, primed, and coated, will not be exſtinguiſhed by Aire, Wind, nor Water. Another, for a <hi>Morter</hi> Peece, take a ſtone ſhot, lower far then the Bore, dip it in molten Pitch,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20146:18"/>Sulpher, Rozen and Turpentine mixed equal parts; then being warme, rowle it in corne powder, with a couer of Fuſtian dipt in molten Roch-fire, and dip it as at firſt, rowle it and couer it, vntil it be of fit height for the Peece: laſtly, dip it in Roch-fire, and rowle it in fine corne powder, and ſhoot it out of the Peece without a Wadd, loaded with 8/10 of its weight in powder, and priming it downe to the ſhot with quicke powder.</p>
            <p>Q. 46. <hi>What are Powder-pots, Pluggs and Creſſets?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Powder Pots are of baked Potters Clay, or thicke glaſſe made with foure eares; vnto which Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches lighted at both ends are to be faſtned, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with powder or quicke receipt, throwne among the Enemie, breakes and takes fire, and makes ſpoile. Pluggs are to be ſhot out of Ordnance like billets but at one end, haue barbed heads of iron to ſticke, and at the other, Ropes dipt in Sope-lee and dried to fly, and not fire; yet the former receipt placed neere the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed head, will fire any combuſtible thing it touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or ſtickes in. Creſſets are iron hoopes hanged on poles, to be leuell in all motions, and they are filled with tooſed match, ſoaked in Sulpher molten 3 li, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre 1 li, Rozen 12 oz, Olibanum, and Antimony of each ½ li, and Linſeed oile to incorpotate them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; if you will haue them reſiſt wind and raine, fill the hollowes with match well beaten, and ſoaked in Sulpher and Powder moiſtned with boiled Linſeed oile, and powder of quicke Lime and Campheere mixed; And fired, it reſiſts wind &amp; water: but to hurt the Enemies eyes, or to poiſon them, or make fleſh fall from the bones, is not fit here to be publiſhed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:20146:19"/>Q. 47. <hi>What are Fire-workes of Triumph, for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and how, and with what receipts and conceits made?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The faſhions, inuentions, and compoſitions of them are infinite, but yet they may be doubly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as their actions are double, either in the aire or water: thoſe that make their operation in the aire are either moueable or fixed; the moueable are either ſimple or compounded: the ſimple moueable, are the Rockets, the ſimple fixed, are the Truncks, Lanthorns and Lights, with ſeuerall ſorts of each: The mouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles compounded, are the Wheeles, Trillers, Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces, Clubs, Targets and flying Dragons: The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound fixed, are the Towers, Caſtles, Arches, Cilin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Pyramides, and others, which of euery ſort are as infinite, as the variety of inuentions may be infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceiued and wrought. Thoſe that worke their effect in the water, either are fired and placed in it, or kindled by the water it ſelfe, and they do either ſwim on the ſurface, as the Rockets, Tumbling-balls, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, Dolphins, Ships, &amp;c. or elſe burne at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, as many weighty workes doe; ſome of which, when they are lighted, and become lighter then ſo much water, they aſcend, ſwim, and burne aboue.</p>
            <p>Q. 48. <hi>How are thoſe that operate in the aire, vſually to be made and compounded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> The moueable airy Fire-works are either Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, or made and contriued with Rockets, they being the ſubſtructure of all the other motions: Rockets are diuerſly framed, either of paper ſix or ſeuen times double, rowled about a former, or they may be of ſtrong light timber turned hollow, or bored, or they may be made of Canuas, in length 6 times the height
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20146:19"/>of their hollowneſſe (if they be vnder the weight of one pound) but if they be of more weight then ſoure and ½ or fiue Diametres, long will be better. Alſo for ſmall Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets they muſt haue the quicker receipts, and for great, flower: As for example, the receipt for Rockets of foure ounces, may be of Powder 4 li, Salpetre 1 li, Coales 4 oz, Sulpher ½ oz; but for Rockets of a pound weight or two, take Salpetre 12 oz, of Powder 20 oz, of Coale 3 oz Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher viue and Scales of iron, each 1 oz, and Rockets of 8, 9, or 10 li. weight, to 8 li of Salpetre, put 2 li 12 oz of Coale, and 1 li 4 oz of Sulpher; For in the great ones no Powder muſt be put, note that theſe materials muſt be finely beaten &amp; ſifted thorow a Searce, and wel mixed &amp; driuen into the Rocket hard, and filled almoſt to the top euery third or fourth driuing, dipping your drift in Gum Dragagant, and Campheere, diſſolued and mixed with ſpirit of wine or good Aquauitae (if the Rockets be to be fired in three or ſoure daies) but if it muſt be a moneth or more firſt; then, in ſtead thereof, dippe the drift ſo in oyle of Petre or liquid Varniſh and Linſeed oile mixed; if you would haue therein any breakers or Buttons, you muſt within one Diametre of the top driue a bottom of leather, or ſix or ſeuen double of paper, vp to the receipt, and pierce and prime it thorow, therunto in ſoure or fiue places; and you muſt alſo arme your Cane and bored Rockets leſt they ſplit: and your flyers muſt haue a ſtraight rod faſtned ſo, that within one or two fingers breadth of the Rocket it may counterpoize the ſame, for the Runners ſwiuels or a Cane faſtned is ſufficient.</p>
            <p>Q. 49. <hi>How make you the Starres?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Take ½ oz of Gum-dragagant and lap it in Croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked-lane blacke iron plate, and roſt it in the embers, till it may be beaten to powder, then diſſolue it in <hi>Aquauita</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:20146:20"/>till it be viſcous or ſlimie, then ſtraine it, and alſo take 4 oz of Campheer, ſteep it 24 houres in other <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitae</hi> vntill it be diſſolued, mix the diſſolutions together, and by little and little ſprincklingly, therewith mix theſe, powdered Salpetre 1 li, Sulpher ½ li, Powder 3 li, Coales ½ li, Amber and Scales of iron, of each 1 li, and mix them all ouer a gentle fire of Charre-coales, and make them in balls as big as you would haue them, and rowle them in mealed powder and Sulpher: you may without the Gumme and Campheere moiſten the ſame powder, only with liquid Varniſh, Linſeed oile, or oile of Petre; but the firſt, is the fairer fire for Starres. The heads of Rockets may be loaded with many things, as with powder ſtrongly lapped and armed in Paper or Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with raining fire, with morcells of Roch-fire or horſe-haires dipped therein molten, Rockets may alſo be made with Barbes, to ſticke and burne whatſoeuer they light vpon, and as a ſhot, they may by a deuice be directed to any place within diſtance aſſigned. Now in regard that all moueable Fire-workes, in Aire or Water, haue their motions from the force of the Rockets ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied accordingly; I need not ſpeake of them particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, but leaue each practiſer to his owne ingenious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention.</p>
            <p>Q. 50. <hi>What are your compoſitions or receipts for Water, Fires, to burne as well at the top, as at the bottome, and of thoſe that water will kindle, or that will laſt long fired?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Take Maſticke one part, white Incence, Gumme Sandrach, quicke Lime, Sulpher, Bitumen, Camphere and Gun-powder, of each three parts, Rozen two parts, and Salpetre nine parts. The Campheer muſt be beaten either with Sulpher, Salt, Almonds, or water, elſe it will not be mealed. This will burne and feed vpon in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20146:20"/>water. But to make a receipt to burne at the bottom, fill a ball with this receipt, Take Sulpher, ½ li, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led powder nine ounces, refined Salpetre one pound, and ½, Campheere beaten with Sulpher and Quick-ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, put and ſtirred into the Sulpher a little molten, all mealed and mixed by hand, and filled into a round Canuas ball, by little and little, and well driuen, being firſt moiſtned with oile of Petre, or Linſeed oile boiled vntill it will ſcald a feather; then arme the Ball, and prime it, balaſt it with Lead at the bottome, that the vent may burne vpwards, or a ſtone to ſinke it, and (hauing fired it well) throw it into the water, and it will burne at the bottome thereof, and fume and boile vp ſlow. Now for as much as all the before-named fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, both moueable and fixed, are but by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of theſe or the like, I ſhall not need (neither is it poſſible) to particular all the inuentions and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties that may be made therein: I will therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, omitting alſo perfumed ſauours and venomous ſents that may be made in Fire-workes, as not fit to be here reuealed. Next for ſuch receipts as the water it ſelfe will kindle, they are made of oyle Benedict one pound, boiled Linſeed oyle three pounds, oyle of the yolkes of Egges one pound, new Quick-lime eight pounds, Sulpher two pound, Campheer foure ounces, and Bitumen two ounces, Or elſe Roch-Petre one pound, Flowers of Sulpher nine ounces, Coales of Rotten-wood ſix ounces, Campheer one ounce and ½, oile of Egges, and oile Benedict ſufficient to paſte the mixture, with new burnt Lime vnſleyked two pound, Or vnſleikt Lime, Tutia, Roch-Petre, Loadſtone, of each one part, Sulpher, Viue and Campheer, of each
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20146:21"/>eight parts, put theſe things in a pot filled with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime in powder and lute, and arme it well with ſtrong wires, and ſet it in a Lime-kill a whole burning time, and the materialls will become a ſtone that any moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture will kindle. A receipt to carry fire alwayes in a mans pocket, is this; Take Cow-dung ſteeped ſoure or fiue times in ſpirits of Wine or Aquauitae, three times diſtilled, wherein Campheer muſt be diſſolued; this muſt be well dried, being made into a Ball and kindled, it will laſt many dayes; it muſt be couered halfe an inch thick with vnſleiked Lime, and the white of Egges well mixed, and when you will vſe it, make a hole with a priming iron, and put a Sulpher match vnto it, and it will light: And ſo Salpetre mixt with the powder of the coales of Iuniper, and the white of an Egge, wil a long time laſt kindled.</p>
